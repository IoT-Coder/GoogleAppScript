This is a How-To for getting a google birthday calendar with own entries and the calcualtion of the age ( if you dont remember :-)  )

to use this code you must have a google login and use personal calendars

enable the google script apps

start a new project ..... name it ... and paste the code from my script-file

You must also setup and allow the usage of Googles : 
* People  API
* Calendar API

if done then launch the AppScript and watch out for the log infos....

if everything was setup correctly then you should modify an exitsing calendar with your new birthday-string for each person
